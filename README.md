# iOS 6 Skeuomorphic Asset Showcase

This repository curates handcrafted icons, wallpapers, textures, typography, and optional audio cues inspired by the iOS 6 era. It doubles as a reference implementation for how contributors should integrate new skeuomorphic assets into the simulator experience.

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. The simulator shell demonstrates lazy-loaded icons, wallpapers, and textures, Inter-based typography (a Helvetica Neue alternative), skeuomorphic CSS utilities, and optional sound effects that respect the user toggle.

## Project Highlights

- **Authentic assets** – Custom SVG icons, linen and brushed metal textures, plus an aqua gradient wallpaper rendered as SVG and optimized WebP.
- **Typography stack** – Inter web fonts loaded via Google Fonts with fallbacks to Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, and system sans-serif.
- **Skeuomorphic utility classes** – Shadows, bevels, highlights, grain overlays, and embossed text helpers in `src/styles/utilities.css`.
- **Lazy asset pipeline** – `AssetLoader` consumes `assets/asset-manifest.json` (generated by `npm run build:assets`) to defer non-critical resources until needed.
- **Sound manager** – `SoundManager` synthesizes classic lock/unlock/tap/notification cues with the Web Audio API and can be configured to play contributor-supplied audio files.

## Scripts

```bash
npm install   # not strictly required (no runtime deps)
npm run build:assets
```

`build:assets` regenerates `assets/asset-manifest.json`. Run it after adding, renaming, or deleting anything in the `assets/` directory.
